# r-project-2019
# R project for Stats course at JAC, 2019. MRCA simulation.
--------------------------------------------------------
## Initializing dependencies:
1. pacman
2. dplyr, ggplot2, ggthemes, plotly
## Setting up development/testing env:
1. Install R from https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html - choose the automatic CDN server link.
2. Clone the repository here: git clone https://github.com/hirumaakane-ha/r-project-2019
3. (Might need to setwd to repository root to run code.)
4. Attention: These scripts were coded on x64-darwin platform with R version 3.6.1, and tested for compability on Ubuntu 19.04 LTS and Windows 10 lastest version in August, 2019. Dependencies and env factors might break if packages are to deprecate in the future.

- Deals with repetition.
- Deals with basic plotting and graphing.

## Exercise 2: Creating functions in R


## Exercise 3: Probability Distributions
* Distributions used in this exercise and the corresponding functions:
